# Reusable React Hooks

This is just a list or react hooks that I've found, or developed that I added as an npm pacakge for easy re-use.

#### From wattenberger.com
* `useIsMounted` For async code, check if the component is still mounted
* `useIsInView` For triggering animations, for example
* `useHash` For keeping the hash of the url in-sync with a local variable
* `usOnKeyPress` For triggering code when a user presses a specific key
* `useChartDimensions` Helps keeps charts / SVG responsive when the windo is resized


#### reactivestack
* `useCookie` 


#### overreacted.io
* `useInterval` Useful for animations`

#### usehooks.com
* `useLocalStorage` For keeping localStorage value in-sync with a local variable

#### From my projects:

* `useImageUpload` - Dependent on how Image Upload is set up (coming soon)
* `useWindowSize` - Helpful if calculating column sizes, for example
